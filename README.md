# Sorts-and-Languages

I am a noob, never did any programming before my 20s. Initially started with some basic Java for non-cs people, some R for statistics and then Python for ML.

Here are some of my favourites:

"My python knows C++ so I dont have to"

"Who is this sudo and how do I shut her down?"

"Back in my days we were writing in Assembler"

<<<<<<< HEAD
"mAtLaB iS iMpOrTaNt yOu kNoW!!" - K. R.

"Python does not scale well, due to being dynamically typed. The problem becomes error handeling" - G. H.

"C makes it easy to shoot yourself in the foot, C++ makes it harder, but when you do it blows your whole leg off" - B. S.
