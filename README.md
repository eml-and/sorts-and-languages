# Sorts-and-Languages

I am a noob, never did any programming before my 20s. Initially started with some basic Java for non-cs people, some R for statistics and then Python for ML.

 Here are some of my favourites:

"My python knows C++ so I dont have to"

"Who is this sudo and how do I shut her down?"

"Back in my days we were writing in Assembler"

"mAtLaB iS iMpOrTaNt yOu kNoW!!!"

"I felt like I had wasting my life when I switched from TF to PyTorch"
