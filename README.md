# Sorts-and-Languages

I am a noob, never did any programming before my 20s. Initially started with some basic Java for non-cs people, some R for statistics and then Python for ML.

Here are some of my favourites:

"My python knows C++ so I dont have to"


"Back in my days we were writing in Assembly"

"Matlab is important..."

"I felt like I had wasted my life when I finally switched from TensorFlow to PyTorch"

"Did you know that the C-Compiler is written in C"
